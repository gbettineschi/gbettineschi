### Something about me
My name is Gabriele. I study Mathematical and Computing Sciences for AI at Bocconi University and am a competitive rower. I'm usually in Milan or on Lake Iseo.

I co-founded Testate Podcast and closed it after 10 episodes and 2.7M views.
I served for two years as Student Government President, I won a bronze medal in the National Math Olympiad and a silver medal in the Debate Olympiad.
I finished first at the 2021 Italian rowing championships and rowed two marathons.

I'm in love with doing.
